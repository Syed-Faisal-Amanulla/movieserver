Developed a comprehensive movie library web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), integrating user
authentication with email verification. Implemented features allow users to search for movies via the OMDb API, create, manage, and share
public or private movie lists similar to YouTube playlists. The project is successfully hosted on Vercel.
